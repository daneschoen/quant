What is space? Maps are representations of space but the more accurate is not necessarily what one would expect. The Australian aboriginal artist Estelle Hogan painted this map of her birthplace, close to the sacred site the Seven sisters.  Although it shows the geography in a more abstract way, it is more accurate in the cultural and symbolic sense. In the aborignal myth the Seven Sisters eventually became the constellation of the Pleiades who came there to drink and camp.
